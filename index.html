<h2>Make your own simple, public, searchable Twitter archive</h2>
<p class="byline"><em>by Darius Kazemi</em>, (<a href="https://github.com/dariusk/twitter-archiver">source code</a>)</p>
<p>Hello! Hopefully you are here because you want to make an archive of your tweets <a href="https://tinysubversions.com/twitter-archive/">like this one</a>. There are options for this like <a href="https://github.com/tweetback/tweetback">Tweetback</a> but you have to have some computer programming knowledge to run that. I wanted to make something very simple. The process for this is:</p>
<ul>
  <li>fill out a small form here</li>
  <li>drop your twitter archive zip file (in the format that it was available circa December 2022) into this page</li>
  <li>wait</li>
  <li>get back a zip file with a bunch of HTML files in it that you can upload wherever you host your web stuff now</li>
</ul>
<p>This even works if you only have access to your website through something like cPanel. Basically if the way you update your website is by uploading files to a web host, then this solution is a good one for you! Once it's uploaded, there is a styles.css file that should be pretty easy to modify if you want to customize things.</p>
<p>Note: your browser will process the whole thing so if it's huge and/or your computer is slow... be prepared to wait a long while. Nothing is uploaded anywhere. You might get a notification that your tab is slowing your browser down. Just wait a while, you'll get an "archive.zip" in your downloads bar. It'll be over soon. Just like Twitter.</p>
<h3>Privacy notice</h3>
<ul>
  <li><em>NO uploading happens in this entire process</em>. Your data stays with you, on the computer where you are running this. When you attach your archive it stays on your computer, running in a local browser app.</li>
  <li>The archive that it spits out will contain your original, public tweets, and any replies that you made to tweets you have authored (so, threads that you made).</li>
  <li>The archive that it spits out will contain no DMs or even any public replies to other people's content (these public replies lack context and I didn't want to open that ethical can of worms here).</li>
  <li>The archive will not contain any private media such as photos you sent via DM.</li>
  <li>The archive will not contain "circles", "moments", "co-tweets", "spaces", or any other non-basic or non-public tweet content.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Known problems</h3>
<ul>
  <li>This won't work if your archive is "too big". This varies by browser, but <strong>if your zip file is over 2GB it might not work</strong>. If you are having trouble with this (it gets stuck on the "starting..." message), you could consider: unzipping locally, moving the /data/tweets_media directory somewhere else, rezipping (making sure that /data directory is on the zip root), putting the new, smaller zip into this thing, getting the resulting zip, and then re-adding the /data/tweets_media directory (it needs to live at "[username]/tweets_media" in the resulting archive). Unfortunately, this will include media for your retweets (but nothing private) so it'll take up a ton of disk space. <strong><em>I am sorry this isn't easier, it's a browser limitation on file sizes.</em></strong> </li>
  <li>Please, don't try to do this on a mobile phone. You'll probably overheat the poor thing.</li>
  <li>If you have unzipped your archive file from Twitter and you threw away the zip, you can re-zip it and try using this tool. The biggest problem I have seen with this is that some zip creator tools add a new directory at the root. Please make sure that your /data directory is at the root of the zip, so when you look at the contents you don't see some other folder you click through before you can see "/data". I am sorry that filesystems are bad.</li>
  <li>If you encounter bugs, please <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScBbu22VFAN-hMABqNRVMLED0JI3sMCSLtmLpnomY-I4AJ5Jg/viewform">contact me via my contact form</a>. I can't promise I will get back to you as this is a free tool I provide because I'm trying to be helpful and nice.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Okay now let's make this archive</h3>
<p>
  <p>
    <input type="checkbox" id="disable-directories" name="disable-directories" />
    <label for="disable-directories">Disable one-directory-per-tweet (not recommended but maybe needed for older filesystems)</label>
    <details>
      <summary>(click for more info about one-directory-per-tweet)</summary>
      <p id="filesystems">Some filesystems (like ext2 specifically) complain if you have more than ~65k subdirectories in a directory, so my original plan of having tweets live at /{username}/status/{id}/index.html (and resolved to /{username}/status/{id}/) doesn't work on those filesystems. Instead all the files live at /{username}/status/{id}.html, so a single directory with thousands of files in it, and you are going to have to provide a .htaccess file or whatever the nginx equivalent directive is to rewrite status/foo/ to status/foo.html. Sorry! <a href="htaccess.txt">This is the .htaccess file I used, if it helps.</a></p>
    </details>
    <p>
  </p>
  <span>Please enter the <strong>base URL</strong> where this will be hosted. This is required if OpenGraph previews (link previews that unfurl in places like Slack and Mastodon) are going to work properly. So if you want a tweet to live at <pre>https://example.com/mytwitterbackup/USERNAME/status/ID/</pre>, then you'll want the text box to have <pre>https://example.com/mytwitterbackup</pre> in it. <em>If you only plan to host this on your own hard drive, then don't worry about this field. It only matters if you want to share these links online with people.</em></span>
  <input type="text" id="baseUrl" placeholder="https://example.com/mytwitterbackup"/>
  <input type="password" id="password" placeholder="encryption password"/>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Now select your .zip file you downloaded from Twitter. Press the "Make my archive" button and the process will begin.</span>
  <input id="file" class="input" type="file" id="file" name="file" /><br />
